def extract_customer_id(user_input):
    # You need to implement this function to extract relevant information
    # For simplicity, let's assume user input contains customer ID directly
    # You might use NLP techniques to extract this information from user input
    # For example, you can use regular expressions, spaCy, or other NLP libraries
    # Here's a simple implementation assuming customer ID is in the format "CO1"
    # You should adapt this based on your actual input patterns
    for word in user_input.split():
        if word.startswith("CO"):
            return word
    return None

def extract_customer_name(user_input):
    # Extract customer name from user input
    # Similar to extract_customer_id, but for names
    # You might use NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER)
    # Or simple pattern matching if the name format is predictable
    # For example, if the input contains "John Doe" or similar patterns
    return "John Doe"  # Placeholder, replace with actual extraction logic

def extract_customer_email(user_input):
    # Extract customer email from user input
    # Similar to extract_customer_name but for emails
    # You might use regular expressions or more advanced NLP techniques
    # For example, if the input contains an email address pattern
    return "john.doe@example.com"  # Placeholder, replace with actual extraction logic
