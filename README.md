## Getting Started:

* Install flutter : [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

### 2. Run on either Android Studios or VSC
* Install Android Studio : [Android Studio Installation](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Using Android Studio's device manager on the top or at the right bar to create a virtual device
1. Select Pixel 7
2. Select Pie on system image
3. Finish\
(You would require at least 8gb to start download and use the virtual device, the space required would increase as you develop on)\

If you wish to proceed the project with VSC, you would need to install android emulator extensions on VSC to run the virtual devices. If you have Code Runner Extensions installed, it is recommended to disable it before compiling the flutter code.
